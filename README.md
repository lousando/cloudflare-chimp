## Docker Setup üê≥

Create a volume mapping at `/config` in the container. In the volume, create a
file called `config.yaml`. Below is a sample configuration file:

```yaml
# Sample Config of /config/config.yaml
ipInfoApiKey: "your-ipinfo-api-key"
cloudflareApiKey: "your-cloudflare-api-key"
updateIntervalInMinutes: 5
records:
  - domain: "example.com"
    subDomain: "photos"
    useCloudflareCDN: true
  - domain: "example.com"
    subDomain: "db"
    useCloudflareCDN: false
```

### Caveats

- Only be 1 ipinfo call made per update interval; this is to keep your request
  count low.
- _ALL_ your records will update at the same interval, there is currently no
  feature to set custom update intervals per-record.
- Only `A` records are supported.
